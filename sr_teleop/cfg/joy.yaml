# Amount by which the joystick has to move before it is considered to be off-center.
# This parameter is specified relative to an axis normalized between -1 and 1.
# Thus, 0.1 means that the joystick has to move 10% of the way to the edge of an axis's
# range before that axis will output a non-zero value. Linux does its own deadzone
# processing, so in many cases this value can be set to zero.

# Rate in Hz at which a joystick that has a non-changing
# state will resend the previously sent message.
autorepeat_rate: $(arg rate)

# Axis events that are received within coalesce_interval (seconds) of each
# other are sent out in a single ROS message. Since the kernel sends each axis
# motion as a separate event, coalescing greatly reduces the rate at which messages
# are sent. This option can also be used to limit the rate of outgoing messages.
# Button events are always sent out immediately to avoid missing button presses.
